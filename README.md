<h3>CVS_Exporter:</h3>
A tool to crudely filter out followbots from your current followers using commanderroots followlist tool (https://twitch-tools.rootonline.de/followerlist_viewer.php) <br>
It will go through the list and if more than 10 people followed in a single second (highly unlikely for normal follows, but common for followbots), it will sort them into the output file

<h3>User_validator</h3>
