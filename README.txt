Bantool 2

New:

  - Doesn't need a focused window anymore
  - Controls its own version of Firefox with multiple instances running in parallel
  - Keeps track of banned users per channel
  - You can now set multiple channels to run on


How to use:
  1)  Unzip FirefoxPortable.7z
  2)  navigate to and open \Bantool-Firefox\FirefoxPortable\App\Firefox64\Firefox.exe
  3)  type about:profiles into the URL tab
  4)  create a new profile called "bantool" save it in the bantool folder \Bantool-Firefox\
      If it doesn't create a proper profile folder (looks like ugcmlygs.bantool) create one yourself
  5)  open bantool profile new window and if needed, set as default
  6)  close and reopen firefox
  7)  log into Twitch
  8)  close out of firefox again
  9)  click main.exe or main.py (python 3.8 or newer needs to be installed for the .py file)
  10) It will generate the necessary files and will ask you to press enter to close it
  11) edit the config.json file:
	- "twitch_channels": ["NAME OF CHANNEL", "NAME OF SECOND CHANNEL", "NAME OF THIRD CHANNEL"],
	- "command": "/ban",
	- "Number_of_browser_windows": 1,
	- "Firefox_profile": "NAME OF PROFILE FOLDER"

  12) The amount of browser windows you should put set is dependent on your computer,
  13) i suggest starting with 1 and working your way up (I can run 8 on a Ryzen 7 3700x)
  14) After filling the namelist and setting the config you can now open the main.exe or main.py again
